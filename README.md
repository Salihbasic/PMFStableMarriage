# PMFStableMarriage

Pything implementation of the Gale-Shapley stable marriage algorithm
using Numpy.

This package provides the basic implementation of the algorithm using
two preference arrays, one for males and another for females, along with
provided random sample generation.

Apart from a very thin built-in wrapper interface, the user is free to use it however
they wish, as it can easily be applied to a simple UI for demonstration purposes
or used for actual problems where the algorithm is applicable.
